Hello! My name is Songela, and I'm a freshman at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

I am often in awe of how talented girls are in so many different realms, and what incredible things women have contributed to the world. Here, I want to show you how fun my adventures in science are and would like to invite you, especially the girls, to join me in the future. I'll be blogging every few days or so about my experiences. I'll also throw in some interesting articles here and there, or even a [music video](http://youtu.be/kHy08ZPav88) just for kicks. Check back often to see cool science in the real world!
