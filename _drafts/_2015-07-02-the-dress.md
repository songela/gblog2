Last June, we [posted a simple brightness contrast illusion]({% post_url 2014-06-22-brightness-contrast-illusion %}) with gray squares that appeared darker or lighter depending on their surroundings. This is the exact same scientific principle at work with the blue & black or gold & white dress!

We are all visual experts; our expertise gets in the way of seeing things as they are
color constancy - tendency of surface to appear same color under a wide range of illumination
	to achieve color constancy, we have to ignore the light around it (which taints our perception of the color)
	same color in different situations looks different (lighting/shadow makes colors look different when they're actually the same)
Bayesian explanation - exact same light reflecting; brain infers that less light hits one of the paths due to shadow
